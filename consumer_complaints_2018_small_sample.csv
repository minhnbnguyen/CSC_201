I DEMAND A FULL INVESTIGATION INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ENFORCEMENT AND ASSIGNMENT IN WHICH I GAVE VALUE TO, PROOF THAT THE CREDITORS HAD ANY LAWFUL RIGHT TO USE MY CREDIT ENTRY AND AUTHENTICATION, FULL COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTING THAT ILLUSTRATES THE DEBIT ENTRY AND CREDIT AND CREDIT ENTRY INTO THE ACCOUNTING UNDER EACH ACCOUNT NUMBER. I REQUIRE ACCOUNTING RECORDS AND THE CONTRACT, THE "" WET INK SIGNATURE CONTRACT, '' OR A COPY OF THE CONTRACT THAT IS AFFIDAVITED FOR VERIFICATION. IF THIS IS NOT ABLE TO BE PRODUCED, BY LAW, THE DEBT SHALL BE DELETED.This constitutes legal notice under federal law that regulates the activities of collection agencies and their representatives. 
They are hereby notified, under provisions of Public Law 95-109, Section 805-C, THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT to hereby CEASE AND DESIST in any and all attempts to collect the above debt.

Pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. 15 U.S.C.A 1601.1692 et al. this constitutes timely written notice that, I decline to pay the attached erroneous purported debt which is unsigned and unattested, and which I discharge and cancel in its entirety, without dishonor, on the grounds of false representation and fraud. No judgment has been entered on this matter. 
15 U.S.C. 1692 ( e ) states that a "" false, deceptive, and misleading representation, in connection with the collection of any debt, '' includes the false representation of the character or legal status of any debt. I have incurred no liability for this debt. 
Said Notice contains, false, deceptive and misleading representations, and allegations intended to pervert the truth for the purpose of inducing me, in reliance upon such, to part with property belonging to me and to surrender certain substantive legal and constitutional rights. To act upon this Notice would divest me of my property and my prerogative rights, resulting in a legal injury to me. 
Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( 4 ), Validation of Debts, they did NOT have evidence to validate their claim that the attached presentment does not constitute fraudulent misrepresentation and that I owe this alleged disputed debt. 

Until the requirements of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act have been met and your claim is validated, they have no jurisdiction to continue any collection activities against me in this matter. I sent a constructive notice that, absent the validation of their claim within 30 days, they must cease and desist any and all collection activity and are prohibited from contacting me, through the mail, by telephone, in person, at my home, or at my work.

Upon doing that I was told that I would be sent a new card. Weeks went by ... no card. So I logged in on XX/XX/XXXX and scheduled my monthly payment for XX/XX/XXXX ( due date ). 
XX/XX/XXXX I still had not received a card and my account was no longer accessible online. I called rep and she said a new card had just been issued and made it so that I was able to set up the new account online. XX/XX/XXXX my payment had not posted to my account, so I contacted Synchrony via their message portal to have record of our conversation. I asked them where my payment was and gave them confirmation #. They replied that it takes 2 business days to process & post. I gave them 5 days before I contacted again. Payment had not posted nor had it been deducted from bank account. I asked them to credit my account for the payment and deal with finding the actual payment later since we were both in agreement that the payment had been made via the confirmation #. 
They contacted me 2 days later and said "" As per your request, our records indicate that an online payment of {$27.00} was cancelled on your account for XX/XX/2018. '' I informed them that I NEVER asked them to cancel a payment ... I asked them to credit my payment and they have the messages there to prove I NEVER requested that. They in turn contacted me 3 days after ( XX/XX/XXXX )  I messaged them this and stated that they had confirmation # for cancellation and they would reverse the late payment fee. 
Since I found out that day that they cancelled my payment, I made them aware that I was making my payment the same day. 
After I contacted them on XX/XX/XXXX again, I logged in to new account to make payment, once logged in I noticed that they doubled my payment due to {$46.00} because of the late fee. Once I contacted them about this they said "" Our records indicate that the payment of {$27.00} was not paid by XX/XX/2018. Please note that the minimum payment due will increase on your account when there is a late payment. The minimum payment due is around 3.5 % of the balance, plus the late fee, plus the interest charge, plus the past due amount. '' The payment was late because THEY cancelled it!! I asked them to reduce minimum due to what it should be but now they won't reduce it to the correct amount. They keep saying I made my payment late! 
I have been back and forth with them up until today. I even spoke to a manage who kept telling me that I logged in and cancelled the payment myself after I kept telling her I didn't. Why would I cancel payment if I didn't have access to old account to log in and cancel ... .and additionally why would I cancel payment if I'm asking you to credit the payment and find it since it already has a confirmation #. It didn't make sense what she was telling me. In customer service pattern after I asked her to stop over talking me and actually listen, she hung up on me. I called back and the new rep said there was no other manager to speak to, there was no one over the manager that hung up on me to speak to and she couldn't do anything because the manager that had hung up on me noted my account ( it's XXXX ... how is she already gone for the day? That was a lie ) that no one could make any adjustments and left for the day. 
I have proof that I did not request my payment to be cancelled. I have proof that Synchrony did that on their own because they sent me email notification that they cancelled it because my account had a balance of 'XXXX '. Which led me to believe that when they opened my new account, my payment was there but instead of letting it sit and wait for the balance from the old account to be transferred over, they cancelled my payment and now are placing blame on me and penalizing me. My minimum due should be $ XXXX- {$27.00}. I have currently been out of work and trying to make my payments on time. The minimum due is what I budgeted for but yet the doubled my payment on me through no fault of mines but are placing fault on me and won't reduce it or adjust it.Saying because statement has already been generated they can't do anything.

So on XX/XX/XXXX I called them to see exactly what I was being garnished for. The lady had all my personal information correct except the year of my birthday. She said the debt was from a credit card and the amount was {$4500.00}. I told her I have never had a credit card! So she sent me to the disputing line. Gave that person all my information and they told me it could take several weeks. I called back the next week to get a update but they had no information on the dispute. So I waited a month and called back. This time I asked more questions. What company did they get my case from? what it was for again? Dates? This lady had a whole other story. It was for a car loan and the amount owed was XXXX. Gave me the previous companies name. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I gave them a call. They never heard of me and informed me they were a credit union no debt collector. Frustrated I, called Stenger & Stenger back. This time I asked they lady to just simply tell me what I'm being garnished for. All she could see was a personal loan in the amount of {$8000.00} and legal fees all XXXX.

10/31/2018,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I disputed 3 charges made by a scam company who never rendered the services paid for. The credit card issuer issuer is CitiBank. On XX/XX/2018 I disputed the 3 charges ( all made on the same day by the same company. I still do not know why they insisted on breaking it into 3 charges instead of one, because the payment was for one contract for services. ). The disputes were acknowledged by Citi and given 3 different dispute numbers by them. They issued conditional credits. The basis of my dispute is that the services paid for were not received in whole or in part On XX/XX/XXXX they sent 3 letters through their system ( which they can send correspondence through, but I cant reply through ), and oddly all 3 letters were different, but basically saying the investigation was closed and credit reversed and advising I could submit further information by XX/XX/2018. I'll try to attach copies of these letters. No merchant provided documents or information was provided to me at any time. 

I did submit more information by XX/XX/XXXX ; a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX and attachments of dispute letters, merchant contract, written communications with merchant by me, copy of cash payments, copy of unidentified trucks, copy of unidentified driver picture. I'll also try to attach a copy of this. 

XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I then received surprising letters from Citi saying basically the merchant didnt agree to a credit, therefore the investigation was again closed. However, I also noticed 2 of the 3 charges were again credited to my account, so I thought maybe this was in response to my letter of XX/XX/XXXX. However, I again received last week, an email from Citi saying there was a message in their system. This message said again that the matter was resolved because the merchant refused to give a credit, therefore my remedies would have to be pursued against the merchant separately. 

I am certain the merchant can not prove they rendered the services because they ceased to exist during the time period they could have done so, because their principals were indicted by the XX/XX/XXXX for their scam practices at that same time, because in fact they did not render the services and because we paid thousands of dollars in cash to others, not affiliated with XXXX XXXX XXXX, to eventually ransom our things out of the hands of strangers. 

To see if I missed anything, and because this process has been so mystifying, I live-chatted with Citi today before filing. They again reiterated that they consider their function to be simply to contact the merchant and get a response, "" not just give a credit. '' They have never provided documents provided by the merchant nor said anything contended by the merchant other than they refuse to give a credit. The burden of proof has oddly been on me the whole time, and they never said I did not prove my dispute, just that the merchant refused to give a credit. I am completely confused by this process ; how disputing a credit card charge became just the card issuer asking the merchant if they want to give a credit or not?!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",OK,730XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,11/5/2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3062068

BBVA Compass bank took almost two months to send the required documents to my insurance company in order for my insurance company to pay my loan off. During this time, BBVA Compass Bank reported missed payments on my auto loan to credit bureaus. The first time my insurance company contacted them about the loss of my vehicle, they did not report it as a total loss.

On XXXX18, BBVA Compass was contacted by my insurance company ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) at which time they ensured my insurance agent that they would email the title to my charger and the certificate of guarantee. On XXXX18, my insurance agent called BBVA again because they had sent the title and the letter of guarantee. However, the letter of guarantee did not have the payoff amount listed on it, which was supposed to be filled out by BBVA Compass.

8/1/2018,Debt collection,Medical debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"I was in the process of buying a home and a few days before closing my lender explained that new collections hit my credit report. I immediately called XXXX XXXX agency and paid the amounts and asked that they delete the collections because I didn't receive notice of the collections. My credit score prior to this occurrence was in the 800 's and now I'm in the mid 600 's. I have two issues with how this was handled. 

1st- the medical debt was one occurrence and they reported it four times which decreased my credit score greatly. 

2nd- I didn't receive bills regarding these collections and If I did, I thought I paid them in XX/XX/2017. Their billing system is very confusing and I was working with the hospital and insurance. They didn't call me to ask why they didn't receive payment and I thought the issue was resolved. I had over 100 k in medical bills and it's very confusing to know what's paid by insurance and what i was responsible for. They claimed that they sent letters but were very vague and unwilling to help me. I am more than willing to pay my bills but XXXX XXXX XXXX don't make it easy. I even called in during this time to verify the collections I paid below and I wasn't notified that there were others sitting out there, I would've paid them had I know. 

3rd- I think it's unfair that my score goes down over a 100 points for services that were unavoidable. I have never had collections in the past and my other trade lines are paid on time and with minimal balances. I am currently doing a renovation loan and thought the issue was resolved until my mortgage lender pulled my credit. The other scoring models I subscribe to rate my credit much higher. I am going to pay a higher rate and fees if this issue isn't resolved and I am hoping you can help with this matter.

I did not have a clear understanding of the repayment options on this loan and the university apparently disbursed the monies to my daughter as she used part of the money to buy a car!

I had the loan deferred several times from early XXXX off and on through early XXXX.

It was never explained to me that this would happen while the loan was in forbearance. Over the next 10 years, I made regular payments. To date, 118 full payments to be exact. The statements from Navient always show different ways of applying the payments to principal and interest with no rhyme, reason or explanation. To date, my balance remains at XXXX.

6/4/2018,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Seized or attempted to seize your property,"Our Mortgage Loan was Originally made with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. We understood this to be a "" Fixed Loan '' and not a Variable. We feel we have been treated very unfairly not only by Ditech Financial LLC ( whom we do NOT have any signed Loan Documents or Contract 's with ; but by their Attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX, XXXX , & XXXX, XXXX.

the letter see received, saw on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX, XXXX , & XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX states : Pursuant to 15 USC 1692g. you are given the following notice : Ditech Financial LLC by and through its servicer, Ditech Financial LLC is the creditor to whom the debt is owed.

1. Ditech is not the Creditor.

The Creditor on the Mortgage Loan is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they are no longer involved in any Mortgage transaction involving our original Loan Agreement.

According to FDCPA Definition of a Creditor ( 4 ) ; 1692a. Definitions ( 4 ) The term "" creditor '' means any person who offers or extends credit creating a debt or to whom a debt is owed, but such term does not include any person to the extent that he receives an assignment or transfer of a debt in default solely for the purpose of facilitating collection of such debt for another.

Ditech did not offer or extend credit creating a debt. Consumer had no offer to accept. And there was no performance as a Creditor as Ditech did not offer or extend credit to create a debt.

In my reply to the Attorney dated XX/XX/XXXX, I asked for proof of our Signatures showing a Contract or Agreement we had with Ditech Financial LLC.

The Lawyer responded with with unofficial copies of the original Mortgage with XXXX XXXX XXXX, and no documentation of proof we have any Creditor/Consumer agreement with Ditech Financial Services, LLC. as I requested they send me! This letter we also did not receive or see untilXX/XX/XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX.

1692i. Legal actions by debt collectors ( a ) Venue Any debt collector who brings any legal action on a debt against any consumer shall ( 3 ) in the case of an action to enforce an interest in real property securing the consumer 's obligation, bring such action only in a judicial district or similar legal entity in which such real property is located ; or ( 4 ) in the case of an action not described in paragraph ( 1 ), bring such action only in the judicial district or similar legal entity ( A ) in which such consumer signed the contract sued upon ; or ( B ) in which such consumer resides at the commencement of the action.

( b ) Authorization of actions Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to authorize the bringing of legal actions by debt collectors. ( Pub. L. 90321, title VIII, 811, as added Pub. L. 95109,  XX/XX/XXXX, 91 Stat. 880. ) EFFECTIVE DATE Section effective upon the expiration of six months after XX/XX/XXXX, see section 819 of Pub. L. 90321, as added by Pub. L. 95109, set out as a note under section 1692 of this title.

2. Referring again to the Letter we received, saw on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX of XXXX, XXXX , & XXXX, XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX states : Pursuant to 15 USC 1692g. you are given the following notice : Ditech Financial LLC by and through its servicer, Ditech Financial, LLC is the creditor to whom the debt is owed.

However, according to the first paragraph in very first Letter we received from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX/Ditech Financial, LLC dated XX/XX/XXXX states that ;... The servicing of your mortgage loan- that is, the right to collect loan payments from you is being transferred from XXXX  to Green Tree effective XX/XX/XXXX. The servicing does not affect any terms or condition of your current mortgage loan, other than the terms directly related to the Servicing of your loan...

3. Every statement or document, including but not limited to Loan Modification Offers etc., we received from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX./Ditech Financial, LLC . always made the Statement and Reference they are a Debt Collector.

The FDCPAs definition of a Debt Collector which I believe to also logically include the Term Servicer is ; 1692a. Definitions ( 6 ) The term "" debt collector '' means any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.

4. How can Ditech Financial LLC be both the Creditor and a Debt Collector/Servicer?

Attorney letter dated XX/XX/XXXX # 2 Ditech Financial LLC by and through its servicer, Ditech Financial LLC is the Creditor to whom the debt is owed.

5. How can a Servicer or Debt Collector Foreclose on a Home?

As I was reading through the Fair Debt Collections Act I found these regarding False or Misleading Representations ( 2 ), & Furnishing Certain Deceptive Forms ; 1692e. False or misleading representations.

A debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section : ( 1 ) The false representation or implication that the debt collector is vouched for, bonded by, or affiliated with the United States or any State, including the use of any badge, uniform, or facsimile thereof.

( 2 ) The false representation of ( A ) the character, amount, or legal status of any debt ; ( stating Ditech Financial LLC is the Creditor ) 1692j. Furnishing certain deceptive forms ( a ) It is unlawful to design, compile, and furnish any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief in a consumer that a person other than the creditor of such consumer is participating in the collection of or in an attempt to collect a debt such consumer allegedly owes such creditor, when in fact such person is not so participating.

( b ) Any person who violates this section shall be liable to the same extent and in the same manner as a debt collector is liable under section 1692k of this title for failure to comply with a provision of this subchapter.

( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX We believe he statement by Ditech Financial LLCs Attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. in his first Communication, Pursuant to 15 USC 1692g. you are given the following notice : Ditech Financial LLC by and through its servicer, Ditech Financial LLC is the creditor to whom the debt is owed.

I notified the apartment manager of my intent on moving out verbally and she stated that she would handle it. 
A few months after I moved out, I received notification that I was in violation of my lease from a credit company. The credit company stated that the violation was due to not giving notification that I was moving out. They stated I owed {$1000.00} due to the violation. I then requested an investigation from both the credit company and my apartment complex. The credit company stated they did an investigation and were told I did notify the complex I was moving but later recanted the move out which is false. I never recanted. The complex told me that they would investigate and contact me. The contact that I had through the complex never called me back to let me know the outcome. After attempting several times to contact her, she emailed me to let me know I would have to file a complaint through the fair housing to seek recourse. This made no sense to me and questioned her credibility as to the thoroughness of her investigation.

The Credit Card holder was an XXXX XXXX Military Member from XX/XX/XXXX until retirement on XX/XX/XXXX,  with a pattern of discrimination dating as far as XX/XX/XXXX, similarly as described within referenced ( b ). 

Prior to my military retirement, Credit Card holder/claimant encountered additional expenses related to that dramatic change of life, with some payments falling behind, but always covered when due notification by creditor was provided. As it pertains XXXX and XXXX XXXX, their statements were always covered, and retained, however, with the American Express Credit Card the contrary was encountered. A new pattern of calls commenced, with collection treats for Payments that were already to be paid on schedule, with hostile collection treats to suspend the Credit Card, which eventually occurred on or about XX/XX/XXXX. The word Puerto Rico immediately raised a red flag that provided lesser benefits, and with an Puerto Rico address it signified summary elimination of the Credit Card privileges. 

Despite 20 years of continued customer relation, their tactical advantage caused the Credit Cards to be rescinded, even when payments were made, with treats that they will never be reinstated. I never pursued AMEX benefits any further, following previous discriminatory encounters, aggravated by the fact that they were responsible for downgrading my Credit Status substantially. Such actions, linked to my separation to the Military Service were a complete violation of The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act ( 50 U.S.C. 3901-4043 ; formerly Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Civil Relief Act ). In addition, the treats of collection, plagued with discriminating statements as I had changed my Address of Record from Continental United States to Puerto Rico, caused AMEX to radically eliminate my Credit Cards ( AMEX PLATINUM and GOLD ). 

Their unnecessary collection practices were unbelievable discriminatory, that the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus Consent Order against AMEX falls short to describe what I had encountered. Subsequently, my Credit Report was substantially affected, and have encountered problems with my Credit Report history as a result of AMEX actions. Further, as it pertains to referenced Consent Order, I personally had to live thru these alleged discriminatory encounters with AMEX collections agents, legal staff and concierge services. To AMEX, the Island of Puerto Rico was considered a Foreign Country, or a Tribal location, without affording any kind of benefits under applicable Consumer Protection Laws. 

I can assure the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus Consent Order has been entirely disregarded by American Express, as it pertains to my particular case. I never received their Notice of Non-Compliance, nor their stipulated resolutions, as I would have taken an entirely different approach back then to obtain resolution and reinstatement of the Credit Card, if deemed appropriate. Their Compliance Plan and Redress actions have failed 100 % as it pertains to my particular case, without taking under consideration numerous violations to The Servicemember Civil Relief Act, not considered under the Consent Order. 

As we stand today, I can assure that AMEX Corporate Board either fell silence to the Consent Order, or willfully disregarded the mandates by making a complete payoff to alleged parties, or perhaps they lacked the necessary fiduciary responsibilities to manage their own affairs when face with Discriminatory Allegations that involves Race, Origin, Place of Birth and Economic Status. No matter how you see it, your Corporate Fiduciary responsibilities lacked an affirmative action policy to prevent encountered events resulting in economic damages to AMEX as a Corporation to redress encountered allegations. The expressed concerns entirely oppose your Corporate Mission Statement and Governance Framework. 

Despite the easy route of seeking a Consent Order, in lieu of Judicial redress by way of Class Action Complaint for encountered allegations [ Despite imposed Alternate Dispute Resolution to Card Holders ], Corporate AMEX and their Board members must understand that jurisdictions within the United States recognize the tort of Bad Faith Acts. Specifically, actions in which Corporate Financial Institutions can be held liable in tort for Bad Faith performance of their duties to Card Holder/Claimant. This tort has strong connections to the implied duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing in contracts. The federal Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) defines Good Faith as Honesty in Fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of Fair Dealing ( UCC 1-201 ( 20 ) ). The expected Good Faith Acts are defined to exclude a variety of types of conduct characterized as 'bad faith ' because they violate community standards of Decency, Fairness or Reasonableness ( R.2d Contracts 205 ). To this date, as it involves my particular case, redress has not been obtained. 

Accordingly, I seek a full restitution of AMEX Platinum Credit Card Priviledges [ Yes, I fully Understand they are Privileges and Not Rights ]. Further, I seek just compensation in way of Military Reduced Annual Fees for AMEX Platinum Card members, and family. Redress must also be obtained with appropriate annotations within the Credit Bureau Reports, along with complainace to applicable mandates contained within Consent Orders. 

If I can be of further assistance with these matters, or to discuss particular events leading to this letter, please contact ( XXXX ) XXXX.

As you can see, there are two bureaus showing XX/XX/XXXX as the first reported 30-day late payment, and Equifax showingXX/XX/XXXX. Realistically the late payments started in XX/XX/XXXX, but XXXX XXXX XXXX has cut off two years of payment history to re-age the credit trade line, which is a serious concern to the Federal Trade Commission. The charge of {$3400.00} was from an overage on mileage on a vehicle lease. The timeline to file a civil action has passed, and the federal guidelines, and the 7-year rule applies as the first reported late shows over the legal time limit. As stated in the Fair Credit Reporting Act : ( A ) In general, if after any reinvestigation under paragraph ( 1 ) of any  information disputed by a consumer, an item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall ( i ) promptly delete that item of information from the file of the consumer, or modify that item of information, as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation ; and XXXX ii ) promptly notify the furnisher of that information that the information has been modified or deleted from the file of the consumer. [ Emphasis added. ] I desire an updated credit report showing a full reinvestigation of the account at the beginning of this credit dispute. I am well within my rights requesting this reinvestigation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. I anticipate a full re-investigative credit report within 30 days. 
ITEMS MAY HAVE SURPASSED LEGAL TIMELINE TO MAINTAIN ON RECORD Case in point, if a credit card payment was late 84 months ago, and since that time the credit card was paid in full, settled for less than full balance, or charged off by a federally insured bank as mandated under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Rule 5000, applicability of applying a charge off standard to debt service, then the creditor must report the true payment history on the credit trade line for a minimum of 84-months. The Federal Trade Commission has levied fines and penalties against creditors for using a re-aging process totally in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act guidelines.

Re-aging of debts have been used by the Internal Revenue Service by re-issuing federal tax liens with a new fining number when the 10-year rule timeline was running out. It is used by creditors as a means of  stalling or delaying ones credit rating, simply by cutting off several years of previous payment histories.

When I was in college my legal name was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I changed it legally on XX/XX/2013 to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This will explain the slight difference you'll see. 

I need to have the unfounded student loan debt wiped out and I need for NAVIENT to correct the debt on my credit report immediately. 

As I stated on our call earlier today, NAVIENT is reporting this debt as {$54000.00} to all three credit bureaus ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) making it look as though I had a {$30000.00} loan and I went over the balance by {$24000.00} this is a 185 % debt to credit ratio and has been hurting my credit for years. 

I'd like for ... Navient Student Loan Services to ...

1. Provide copies of all student loan agreements/contracts that they say I signed for a total of {$30000.00} 2. I'd like for the true amounts to be recalculated and interest on the new balance corrected for the past 26 years 3. I'd like for my credit reports to reflect all true and factual numbers 4. I'd like for my credit report to reflect the true balance of the actual loan amounts they say I owe to all credit bureaus 5. I'd like for my credit report to reflect the interest as part of the balance and not reflect that I went over the balance by {$24000.00} as it does now. 

Keep in mind that i have hired an attorney to try and get them to do the right thing and they did not provide proof to us about loan amounts, nor did they correct the reporting on my credit reports.

3/11/2018,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"Over the course of XXXX, several financial setbacks occurred causing me to fall behind on my payments so I made steps to work with the Ocwen to begin working on a loan modification so that I could continue making timely payments. Over the course of this process the relationship managers that I worked with repeatedly lost documents and even went as far as saying that they did not receive documents that were faxed, emailed, and mailed to them which ultimately led to me falling further behind on my payments. 

In late XXXX, I received a notice of default and subsequent sale date so I began to work with the loan servicer as well as Keep Your Home California and XXXX to work out a repayment plan for the back fees. They assured me that while I was working with them to figure out a plan that the sale date had been put on hold. In XXXX, XXXX informed me that they had made an agreement that I would begin with an initial payment of {$12000.00} and then go on from there. I felt comfortable with that amount because it was much less than the {$16000.00} that was accumulating after fees and penalties were tacked on. 

I called the servicer in early XXXX because I had not received any documents to sign and after speaking to my relationship manager in late XXXX, I was informed that I should remit a payment of {$12000.00}, which was sent to them on XX/XX/XXXX via certified check even though as of that date I still had received no official document that we had entered into the repayment plan. It was on XX/XX/XXXX, that I received a new document from the county saying that my home would be sold on XX/XX/XXXX, so I immediately called the loan servicer because there had been no communication from them on the status of the repayment plan or any document stating that they had received a payment from me. 

I spoke to the servicer who then told me that the repayment plan was sent to the underwriter and that I had been denied a repayment plan due to my debt to income ratio being 2 % higher than that of which they allow. I then asked when that decision had been made and they told me that the decision was made XX/XX/XXXX. I then asked the representative why I had not received anything in writing that this decision had been made and I was told it was because they do not send out letters of denial and that it was on me to check in with them on the status of the repayment plan application. I know that this is false information because I have received letters in the past in regards to the denial of a loan modification. I proceeded to ask the representative what happened to the check that was sent to them and they told me that they had returned it to me as of XX/XX/XXXX because there was no agreement made and that I would need to make a payment of {$17000.00} to end the sale of my home. This payment has to be made by XX/XX/XXXX. 

I am submitting this complaint because Ocwen has a history of these types of practices resulting in foreclosures and lawsuits, one of which was filed by the CFPB for these same reasons and nothing has changed.",,OCWEN LOAN SERVICING LLC,CA,,,Consent provided,Web,3/12/2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2839339

3/8/2018,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"Good afternoon, I have a credit card from American Express and today I received an email from them stating that they have lowered my credit limit from {$18000.00} to {$7000.00} effective today. I currently have a balance of approximately {$6800.00} dollars. The only reason I put that amount of money on this card was because they had extended this {$18000.00} line of credit to me and I decided to use more than I usually do even though I know they will charge me interest ( these past months I have had to incur in more expenses than normal ). I am however paying off the card off in the following XXXX months ( as was my original plan ). However they informed of this credit limit decrease today without prior warning. Had I known that they would do that I would have never, ever opened a card with them. I opened this card in XX/XX/XXXX and I have never missed a single payment on the card and until recently I had always paid the full amount ( in the past few months however I have been making minimum payments to this card so I could take of other necessities ). Not only did they lower my credit limit which will affect my utilization rating and subsequently lower my XXXX XXXX, which will in turn increase my cost of borrowing should the need arise. Also what happens if with the interest they charge me, my balance goes above the credit limit? I would have to pay additional fees that would not have been charged had my credit limit been unadjusted. Not only that but when I call the customer service line to discuss what happened, they tell me that they had a solution for me which was for me to make a payment of 50 % of what I owed before early XXXX of this year, they would restore my credit to {$18000.00}. 

I truly feel that tactics like these should be illegal ( not to mention just horrible business practices because I will be closing my account as soon as I have finished paying off the balance ). How can a company tell me I have a credit limit of X and then all of a sudden lower that limit to Y without any prior warning whatsoever? What's the point of giving me {$18000.00} credit if in reality as soon as I reach less than half of it they will lower my XXXX XXXX and put me in a precarious position which would plunge me into even more debt should I not bow down to their demands.

2/26/2018,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I am respectfully requesting removal and elimination of a XX/XX/XXXX late fee of {$100.00} charged to my account as the payment being sent in a manner resulting in late credit was result of misinformation communicated by phone directly from a Fay Servicing rep in XX/XX/XXXX. 

My mortgage was bought by Fay Servicing and transferred from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Myself and many consumers had industry standard and best practices expectations that payment processing would be the same as with major banks providing mortgages such as XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX etc. 

I had had a number of conversations with Fay reps by phone about the expectation of continuing to make my mortgage payments via XXXX XXXX billpay and having payments process and credited in 24-48 hours as had been the case with XXXX XXXX XXXX. This was and is the expectation of other customers, using other banks, whose mortgages were transferred to Fay Servicing as well. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that my payment to them via XXXX XXXX had taken way longer than 24-48 hours to process. It had taking 7 - 10 days. I contacted XXXX XXXX and was informed that XXXX XXXX had directed XXXX NOT to send payments electronically ( which process much quicker eliminate possibility of lost paper checks and is more secure ). According to XXXX XXXX they had been directed by Fay Servicing, has had the other major bank, to ONLY send payments as PAPER checks by way of old fashion mail. I contacted Fay Servicing Customer Service again by phone to get an understanding of payment processing and reconfirm I would be able to pay electronically via XXXX XXXX XXXX billpay. The person at Fay Servicing that I spoke with said "" What we are seeing with accounts like yours transferring to us is that the first 1-2 payments come in a paper checks and then from that point forward payments transition to electronic payments. '' It was based on this conversation that I initiated my XX/XX/XXXX payment via XXXX XXXX billpay with the expectation that the payment would process in 24-48 hours. This turned out to not be the case. Since my employer pays once monthly I initiated my XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX with the expectation the payment would process electronically in 24-48 within the Fay Servicing grace period and without a late charge. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX XXXX of Fay Servicing introducing herself as my point of contact. I asked for confirmation that my XX/XX/XXXX payment had been received. She said it had not. I recounted my prior experience and detailed conversation I had had with the prior Fay rep and expectation that the XX/XX/XXXX payment would process electronically in 24-48 hours. I relayed details of my conversation with XXXX XXXX. I also relayed that I had double checked initiation and processing of my payment via my XXXX XXXX website where I could see the payment initiated XX/XX/XXXX and money out of my account XX/XX/XXXX which I took to mean my payment had processed in a timely manner. 

XXXX XXXX told me the other rep had been incorrect and that Fay would NEVER be accepting and processing bank billpay payments electronically. In other words customers who wished to use their banks ' billpay systems to protect themselves and their financial information would only be able to use bill pay to make payment via paper checks and old fashion mail. 

By the time I had this conversation with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX my XX/XX/XXXX payment via XXXX XXXX billpay was processing. It was in the conversation with XXXX XXXX I determined the XX/XX/XXXX payment would be credited late because I had assumed as the other Fay rep had told me this XX/XX/XXXX payment would process electronically in 24-48 hours. 

Fay rather than allowing customers to use, and accepting, the readily available electronic billpay system all customers have available and all major banks providing mortgages ( like XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, etc ) which process more quickly, eliminating problems of loss and fraud -- Fay pushes customers to provide sensitive financial information including bank name, routing numbers and account numbers to be collected on the Fay site as the only option to NOT mailing a paper check. With increased vulnerability, financial data theft, and hacks the last thing in customers ' best interest is disseminating and exposing personal and financial information to billers. Allowing mortgage holders to use established bill pay systems through their banks is a standard normal expectation and best practice. 

And even if I had, which I do not, provided personal banking financial information on the Fay site in order to pay via their site I could not because of the {$100.00} late charge and only preset inflexible fixed payment amounts pre-input by Fay Servicing as payment options. As a result customers like myself that want to pay a customized specific amount can not dose on the Fay site and can only do so by calling in to speak with a live human at Fay Servicing FYI via my online research there have been a number of other customers raising issues and concerns regarding late charge experiences with Fay Servicing.
